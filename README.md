# Train on your data
In order to train the model on your data follow the steps below 
### 1. data preprocessing 
* prepare your data and make sure the data is formatted in an CSV format as below 
```
audio_path,text,duration
file/to/file.wav,the text in that file,3.2 
```
* make sure the audios are MONO if not make the proper conversion to meet this condition

### 2. Setup development environment
* create enviroment 
```bash
python -m venv env
```
* activate the enviroment
```bash
source env/bin/activate
```
* install the required dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Training 
* update the config file if needed
* train the model 
  * from scratch 
  ```bash
  python train.py
  ```
  * from checkpoint 
  ```
  python train.py checkpoint=path/to/checkpoint
  ```
